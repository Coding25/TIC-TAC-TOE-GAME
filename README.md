# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players, traditionally represented as "X" and "O," take turns marking empty cells in an attempt to have three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
<br>
The program consists of:<br>
1) The game is played on a 3x3 grid initially empty.<br>
2) Two players take turns to make their move. One player uses "X," and the other uses "O".<br>
3) Players alternate turns, placing their symbol in an empty cell of the grid during each turn.<br>
4) The game is won when one player successfully forms a line of three of their symbols in a row. Then it shows the Winner and invites for the new game if he/she is interested to play again.<br>
5) If the entire grid is filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is a draw and again the player is invited for the new game.<br>
